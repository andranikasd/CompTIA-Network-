# Network Components

## List of Network Components
    - Clients 
        Devices that users access the network with
    - Servers
        Provides resources to the network
    - Hubs
        Older network devices that connect other devices like clients and servers over a local area network
    - Switches 
        "Smarter Hubs" that provides more security and more efficient bandwidth utilization
    - Wirless Access Points (WAPs/APs)
        Allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network
    - Routers
        Used to connect different networks toether
    - Firewalls
        Security barriers between internal networks and the external networks (Can be hardware based, software based or in combination of both)
    - Load Balancers
        Devices or software that distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers
    - Proxy 
        Acts as an intermediary between users device and internet
    - Intrusion Detection Systems & Intrusion Prevention Systems
        IDS: Detect unauthorized access or anomalies and alert administrators
        IPS: Not only detect threats, but also take action to prevent intrusion
    - Controllers
        In Storage-Defined Networking (SDN) context, these are central units used to manage flow control to networking devices
    - Network-attached Storage (NAS) Devices
        Dedicated file storage system that provides data access to a heterogeneous group of client
    - Storage Area Networks (SANs) 
        High-Speed network that provides access to consolidated block-level data storage
    - Media
        In networking it refers to the physical material that is used to transmit data
    - Wide Area Network (WAN) Links
        Used to connect networks over large geographical areas
