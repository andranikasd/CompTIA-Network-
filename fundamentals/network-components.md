## What's a Network? 

Network is a group or system of interconnected people and things. In IT network means two or more connected computers that can share resource, such as data and applications, office machines, an Internet connection, or some combination of these.

## The Local Area Network 

Local Area Network(LAN) is usually restricted to spanning a particular geographic location such as an office building, a single department within a corporate office, or even a home office.
Back in the day, you couldn’t put more than 30 workstations on a LAN, and you had
to cope with strict limitations on how far those machines could actually be from each
other. Because of technological advances, all that’s changed now, and we’re not nearly as
restricted in regard to both a LAN’s size and the distance a LAN can span. Even so, it’s still
best to split a big LAN into smaller logical zones known as workgroups to make adminis-
tration easier.
